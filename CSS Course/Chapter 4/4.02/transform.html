    <p>The transform property can be used to animate and make elements live on a site. The transform property is still not a fully develped feature in CSS3, so some code may turn out differently.</p>
    <p>One subset of the transform property is the translate feature. Translate will make an element move or hop a number of pizels in a direction (Left or Right: X Direction, Up and Down: Y Direction). Before translate, we need to put webkit since this is not fully developed and we are using chrome. The word would differ for different browsers(ex.moz-transform,etc.).</p>
    <p>Another subset of the transform proptery is the scale feature. The scale feature will make the image smaller or bigger (ex. scale: (2.0) means that the new image will be twice the size.).</p>
    <p>The rotate property will rotate the element. A positive degrees will rotate it clockwise, while a negative degrees will rotate it counterclockwise.</p>
    <p>The skew feature will distort an image. When looked at regularly, the image has 90 degree coreners. But when using skew, one can distort the shape of the image (ex. skew(45deg) means that the image will now have 45 degree corners.</p>
