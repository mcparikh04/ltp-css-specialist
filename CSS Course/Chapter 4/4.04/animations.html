    <p class="animation">I am animated! I am animated! I am animated! I am animated! I am animated!</p>
    
    <p>In this example, we used an at-rule and keyframes to make a color change. We used the animation proprety with the webkit to turn the red box to blue. We set the time in seconds. Keyframes state how the element is going to be be changed. We hav the to and from background colors of red and blue</p>
    <p>We can also use percentage keyframes. The percenteges somewhat signify to and from and in this way, we can have multiple keyframes.</p>
    <p>We can use the animation iteration count property to make our animation run more than one time.</p>
