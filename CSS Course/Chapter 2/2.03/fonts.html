<h1>Welcome to my page where I am going to learn how to style with different fonts.</h1>    
<p class="paragraph"> Hello. Here is a smaple paragraph. I have linked a CSS sheet externally so that I can play around with different CSS fonts. I have created one class above, called "paragraph."</p>
<p>There is the font-weight, font-family, font-style, and font-size. Be careful with typing in any font you would like, because in order for the font to show up on a user's computer or device, the font has to be registered with the computer. As seen in the external CSS page, you can type in many fonts so that the computer will try each one in orderd until one works. </p>
