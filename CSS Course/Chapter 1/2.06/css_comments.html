    <h1>Welcome to my new website!</h1>
    <p>Here is a smaple paragraph. This is just some text to help us see what CSS can do.</p>
    <p>To make comments in CSS, use and asterisk and a slash to make comment. Like HTML Comments, they do not change the outcome of the page.</p>
    <p>CSS Comments can also disbale parts of code, as shown above. The comments will make it look like the code disabled is not really there.</p>
