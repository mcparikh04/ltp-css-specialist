    <p>The display property can be used to play around with the position of different elements. We have looked at the block and inline display attributes. When inline is the attribute for te display property, any element or elements in the section with fill as much space as they can and then move to a new line and keep displaying. On the other hand, elemtns in the block attribute section start on a new line, display the element give, and then move to a new line for the next elements. Block elements never appear to the right of another element. </p>
    <p>We also loked at the line height and what it can do for elements. The line height for an inline elemnt for many elements is always the element with the biggeset line height. A s can see, the TEST TEXT was given a line height of 50px, and the whole line got a 50px line height. Hence, there is more space on the top and bottom of the element.</p>
    <p>If we switch the display propteries for the squares and text, we get something different. The TEST TEXT block element appears on a new line, and has aline above and below it. However, the squares are gone in the right box. Recall that inline elements are shown with the height of the largest block element height there is. However, we have not set a line height so the computer assumes it is zero, and there is no space to show the elements.</p>
    <p>If we want the two boxes to display nex to each other, we can use the inline-block attribute to do so.</p>
